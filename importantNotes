2) "emit" is a function which "emits" a certain event with some value.
3) "on" is a function which "grabs" the "emitted event" by its name and perform any operation
4) "broadcast.emit" emits the message to all the active clients except the user who is source of the message
5) "broadcast..to("roomName").emit" emits the message to all the active clients on a "particular room" except the user who is source of the message.
6) "socket.join("roomName")" lets to join user to a particular room

) "socket" is a server for a specific user at a time, so, it emits to only a single user any event like "message" = "welcome himanshu"
) "io" is a public server, which emits any message over all the active clients like "message" = "Himanshu has joined the Chat"

) "connection" & "disconnect" are keywords for the "when user connects" & "when user Disconnects"
